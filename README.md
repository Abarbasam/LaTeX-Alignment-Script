# LaTeX-Alignment-Script
Python Script that allows you to easily create great looking equations in a LaTeX align environment. This script is specifically designed to allow you to align multiple different equations alongside each other.

If you want to have multiple different equations beside each other, it can be frusturating and confusing to have to write the 1st line of the first equation, then the 1st line of the second equation, and so on. With this script, you can write each equation and its solution(s) in "blocks." The script will align these blocks beside each other, making easy to read text and a good-looking LaTeX document
